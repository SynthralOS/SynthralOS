I need you to build a next-generation AI Workflow Automation Platform named SynthralOS, an AI-first solution that combines robust SaaS functionalities with advanced AI orchestration, no-code workflow building, API integrations, OCR, scraping, OSINT, memory, RAG, and agent-driven automation. The platform should support both cloud and self-hosted deployments. Below is a detailed breakdown of the project requirements, including tech stack, features, Supabase schema, agent task execution pipeline, and implementation roadmap. I’ve already built an initial MVP, accessible at https://automationflow.lovable.app/templates (for pre-built workflow templates) and https://automationflow.lovable.app/builder (for the visual builder interface), which you should use as a starting point for the Langflow-based UI. SynthralOS should include SaaS features like authentication, billing, content management, admin/dashboard, and email integration alongside the new AI workflow automation capabilities. Please implement this in a modular, scalable, and well-documented manner, ensuring all features work seamlessly together.
Project Overview
Project Name: SynthralOS
Objective: Build a platform that combines a robust SaaS foundation with advanced AI workflow automation, empowering technical and non-technical users to automate tasks, integrate with external services, leverage AI for data processing, OCR, scraping, OSINT, memory, and RAG, and manage subscriptions, content, and analytics.
Target Audience:
Non-technical users (e.g., small business owners, marketers) for simple automation and content access.

Technical users (e.g., developers, data scientists) for advanced scripting, OCR, scraping, and AI.

Agent Task Execution Pipeline
Overview
Layer

Role in Task Execution

Arch Gateway

First line of defense: Validates incoming prompts/tasks, routes them to the right agent or engine, enforces guardrails, rate limits, and fallback rules. “Don’t let malformed or dangerous input through.”

Pydantic / Zod

Input/output contract enforcers: Used by Cline nodes and LangGraph steps, ensures agent-generated logic or flow steps are valid, throws errors early if schema is violated. “Make sure agent-written code behaves and returns clean results.”

Archon

Self-refining agent layer: Detects when tasks are failing or underperforming, modifies steps (code, tool, memory config), suggests or auto-applies reordered steps, retries, or new tools. “Hey, that didn’t work—I rewrote the logic and re-ran it successfully.”

LangGraph

Orchestration framework: Connects all layers, tracks execution state, conditions, failures, and recovery paths, enables multi-agent routing and fallback.
Example: Email Scraping Task Flow
User triggers: “Scrape unread emails, summarize, and update Notion.”

Arch Gateway: Validates input schema → routes to correct agent (e.g., EmailAgent).

Agent begins flow → uses steps in LangGraph.

Pydantic catches bad selector → fails.

Archon steps in:
Reorders flow to check auth → then scrape.

Rewrites logic: adds a loop + retry.

Passes new version through Pydantic again.
Agent finishes task → logs routed via Supabase/Signoz.
Summary
This pipeline ensures self-repairing, intelligent task execution with Arch Gateway as the gatekeeper, Pydantic/Zod as the validator, Archon as the fixer, and LangGraph as the orchestrator.

Risk: LangChain AI Reliability
Mitigation: Implement error handling in LangGraph with Archon for self-repair, log errors in agent_trace_history.
Risk: User Adoption
Mitigation: Leverage Langflow’s intuitive UI and Clay UI for beginners, with pro-code options via Codex Studio.
Risk: Cost Overruns
Mitigation: Optimize LangChain usage, offer self-hosting, track costs in model_cost_logs.
Conclusion
SynthralOS combines a robust SaaS platform with advanced AI workflow automation, providing authentication, billing, content management, and a modern UI alongside AI-driven workflows, OCR, scraping, OSINT, memory, and RAG capabilities.
